# Backend Tutorial 🚀

Welcome to the **Backend Development Tutorial** repository!  
This project covers the basics of building backend applications — from setting up a server to creating APIs and integrating databases.

---

## 📌 Overview

This repository is part of my backend development learning series. The goal is to help beginners understand how backend systems work and how to build them step by step.

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **Node.js**
- **Express.js**
- **MongoDB**
- **Mongoose (ODM)**
- **dotenv**
- **JWT Authentication (optional)**
- **Postman for API Testing**

Backend/
├── controllers/ # Logic for API functions
├── routes/ # API endpoints
├── models/ # Database schema
├── config/ # DB & environment config
├── server.js # Main app file
├── .env # Environment variables
├── package.json # Dependencies & scripts

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. **Clone the Repo**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Darshanwalher/Backend.git
2. Navigate to the Project
cd Backend
3. Install Dependencies
npm install
4. Setup Environment Variables
Create a .env file and add:

PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
5. Run the Project
npm start
📡 API Endpoints (Example)
Method	Endpoint	Description
GET	/	Server health check
POST	/api/users	Create a user
GET	/api/users	Get all users
(Update this table based on your real endpoints)

🧠 What You’ll Learn
How to build RESTful APIs

How to connect to a database (MongoDB)

How to work with routes, controllers & models

How to use environment variables

How to handle errors and responses

📚 How to Use
Review each folder and file structure

Read code comments for explanations

Use Postman or other API tools to test endpoints

Modify and extend the tutorial with your own ideas

💡 Tips
Add API documentation (Swagger or Postman collection)

Add tests (e.g., Jest or Mocha)

Deploy your backend and link in the README
